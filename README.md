# Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-for-Cabs-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains the code and resources for a dynamic price prediction model for cab services. The project aims to predict the prices of cab rides based on various factors such as distance, time, demand, and other relevant variables.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of cab rides in real-time. By considering multiple factors, such as distance, time, and demand, the model aims to provide dynamic and accurate price estimates to both the cab service providers and the customers.

The project includes the following key components:
Data Collection
The project utilizes historical data from cab rides, including attributes such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, distance, and fare amount. This data is used for training and evaluating the prediction model.

Feature Engineering
The collected data is preprocessed and transformed into meaningful features. This involves extracting relevant information, handling missing values, and performing feature scaling, if required.

Model Development
Various machine learning algorithms and techniques are explored to develop a predictive model. The model is trained using the historical data, and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

Real-time Prediction
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make real-time predictions. The model takes input from the current cab ride request, including pickup and drop-off locations, and provides an estimated fare amount based on the learned patterns.
